# Welcome ⚛️

**Welcome to the GEEM lab!**

We are located in the [Department of Chemistry](https://qmc.ufsc.br/) at the [Federal University of Santa Catarina](https://ufsc.br/),
Florianópolis, Brazil.

We are committed to shedding light on the physical nature of unusual bonding situations,
particularly those that take part in molecular recognition and self-assembly processes, materials, and transition metal complexes.

This [GitHub organization](https://github.com/geem-lab)
and the [website](https://geem-lab.github.io)
are oriented toward people interested in computational chemistry and its applications,
providing them with a glimpse of our ongoing research activities and ourselves.
